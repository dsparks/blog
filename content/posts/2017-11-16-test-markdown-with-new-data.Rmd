```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      comment = "#    ",
                      cache = TRUE,
                      dev = "CairoPNG")
```

## Here is some preamble

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

First, load all of the packages we need:

```{r load_packages, collapse = TRUE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, message=FALSE, results = "hide"}
toLoad <- c("stringr", "lubridate", "tidyr", "dplyr", "Hmisc", "ggridges",
            "ggrepel", "ggraph", "forcats", "readr", "rvest", "ggplot2",
            "igraph", "viridis", "zoo")
lapply(toLoad, library, character.only = TRUE)

# (Package loading messages are suppressed)

```

## Load data

This data comes from [website]. Describe it here.

```{r load_data, collapse = TRUE, results='asis'}
setwd(gsub("content/posts", "data", getwd()))
Refs <- read_tsv("cross_references.txt")

# Rename columns to omit spaces
Refs <- Refs %>%
  dplyr::rename(fromVerse = `From Verse`,
                toVerse = `To Verse`) %>%
  dplyr::select(fromVerse, toVerse)

Refs %>%
  sample_n(20) %>%
  knitr::kable() %>%
  row_spec(1, bold = TRUE)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
